/*
  # Fix all RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion and 500 errors

  1. Security Changes
    - Remove all policies that cause infinite recursion
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies
    - Handle admin access through application layer
    
  2. Policy Updates
    - Users table: Simple policies without self-referencing
    - All other tables: Use direct auth.uid() checks where possible
    - Remove complex EXISTS queries that reference users table
